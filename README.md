# Can You Crack The Code Solver
This is a solution to check if there is a solution for solving code in the game [CAN YOU CRACK THE CODE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SevenFeb.CanYouCrackTheCode&gl=US) (Link to Google Play)

Solution is made with using different languages, so you can analize how it make that solution.
## Developed Solutiions
| Programming Language | Solution ready | How well is it made | Modules/Libs/Functions used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Javascript | Yes | Fair enough (there is a posibility for having up to 3 solutions with 4 length code) | <ul><li>lodash</li><li>readline-sync</li></ul> |
| Python | Yes | Fair enough (there is a posibility for having up to 3 solutions with 4 length code) | <ul><li>itertools.product</li><li>collections.Counter</li><li>re.search</li></ul> |
| C/C++ | Yes | Fair enough (there is a posibility for having up to 3 solutions with 4 length code) | <ul><li>iostream</li><li>vector</li><li>string</li><li>algorithm</li><li>iterator</li></ul> |
